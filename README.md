There's not much to say about me. One thing I can do is freehand-draw mazes of various different styles and disigns.
I'm currenty pursuing a mechanical engineering degree. I'm interested in learning about different types of mechanics and how smaller components of machinery work together.
I'm not working on much of anything big right now other than school work. I used to work on many different big projects, mostly crafty-like projects. I would try to build mechanically functioning dispensers out of cardboard and duct tape, and then I made a few mechanical candy machines out of legos, and then I started playing Minecraft and made a bunch of complicated contraptions out the game's "electrical" content (It's called redstone in the game.), which like the previous things involved lots of problem-solving. I've always like puzzle-based things.

Now days, I have a huge passion for basketball and improving my skill at that. That is sort of my hobby. I don't have as much free time now as I did before, but when I do, I usually spend my time shooting around at some public basketball courts, or the rec center when it's open and not crowded. Bigger projects require more free time than what I have currently.

That's all I will include in this for now.
